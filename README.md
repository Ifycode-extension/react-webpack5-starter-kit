# React + webpack 5 starter kit

## Development setup

- React 17
- Webpack 5
- Babel 7
- Eslint

**Note:** You can checkout the [less config create react app](https://github.com/Ifycode/less-config-create-react-app) instead, if you prefer to use (less preprocessor with) create react app.

## Install dependencies

Install dependencies with the yarn command below if you are using yarn, or install dependencies with the npm command below if you are using npm.

````
yarn install
````

OR

````
npm install
````

## Run the application

Use the command yarn command below to run the application at localhost:5050 if you are using yarn, use the npm command if you are using npm.

````
yarn start
````

## LESS and SASS configuration
LESS configuration is added in the webpack config, so you can import less files directly into js files. If you wish to use SASS or any other preprocessor instead, add configuration for it in the webpack config.
